(The date is pretty solid; the start/end times are more tentative and might change.)

This monthly 4-hour tutorial will present a short introduction to a
topic in computer coding and software development, aimed at adults who
are taking an online course or are curious about computer
programming. In each session, you'll learn some of the basics and then
try simple exercises and problems. Be sure to bring your own
WiFi-equipped laptop to participate.

Learn to use Git, used for recording the revision history of computer
code, and explore the Github web site used to share code and
collaborate on development.
