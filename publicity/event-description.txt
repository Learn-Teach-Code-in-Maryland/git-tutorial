Learn, Teach, Code:

This monthly N-hour tutorial will present a short introduction to a
topic in computer coding and software development, aimed at adults who
are taking an online course or are curious about computer programming.
In each session, you'll learn some of the basics and then try simple
exercises and problems. Be sure to bring your own WiFi-equipped laptop
to participate.
