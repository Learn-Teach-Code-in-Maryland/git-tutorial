Github Demo:

Show a repository repo:

https://github.com/numpy/numpy

First, the code section:

22500 commits -- list of commits

* click on a commit: show the diff

Branches: lists the active branches

Contributors: shows who can contribute to the software.
Pulse: rate of recent changes

You can create a repository & host it, & just use it for yourself,
but Github is also intended to help a team of people coordinate.
Features for this: tracking bug reports, or issues; and pull requests,
diffs that have been submitted for incorporation in the software.

First, issue tracking.

Show list of issues.
Click on an issue -- show discussion.
This is life for professionals -- looking at tickets and discussing them.


Look at a PR:
show the conversation.
Files changed: is the diff.
Commits: shows the individual commits making up the change.
Checks (an advanced feature): can configure automated checks like
running tests, syntax checks.
